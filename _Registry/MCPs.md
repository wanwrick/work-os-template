## Usage Patterns

### Notion (Primary Knowledge Base)
```
Search → notion-search (semantic search across workspace)
Read → notion-fetch (get page content by URL or ID)
Create → notion-create-pages (new pages with markdown content)
Update → notion-update-page (modify properties or content)
Query → notion-query-database-view (query database views)
```

### Gmail (Communication)
```
Find emails → gmail_search_messages (Gmail search syntax)
Read → gmail_read_message or gmail_read_thread
Draft → gmail_create_draft (never sends without confirmation)
```

### Google Calendar (Scheduling)
```
View schedule → gcal_list_events (time range + calendar)
Find availability → gcal_find_meeting_times (multi-person)
My free time → gcal_find_my_free_time
Create event → gcal_create_event (with attendees, meet link)
```

### Google Drive (Document Access)
```
Search → google_drive_search (query syntax)
Read → google_drive_fetch (by document ID)
```

## Important Notes

- **Notion is the live reference**: meeting notes, project docs, and team wikis live there
- **Gmail drafts only**: Claude creates drafts, never sends without explicit approval
- **Calendar actions**: creating events requires confirmation
- **All MCPs require active connection**: if a connector isn't available, fall back to the knowledge in this project
